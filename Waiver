that failure to successfully defuse said bomb could result in catastrophic consequences, including but not 
limited to: severe injury, loss of limb, existential crises, irreparable property damage, the complete 
annihilation of your surroundings, and, most notably, your own untimely demise. By clicking 'I agree,' you 
expressly waive any right to complain, seek legal action, or otherwise hold any individual or organization 
liable for your ultimate fate. This waiver serves as your binding agreement to willingly attempt to defuse 
the bomb at your own peril, and you affirm that you are of sound mind (at least right now) and are making 
this decision without coercion, despite the clear and present danger. Remember, ticking clock sounds 
are purely optional but very, very real. 
By clicking "I agree," you accept the terms."""
